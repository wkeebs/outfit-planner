# Welcome to Outfit Wizard!
A web app for generating outfits for all weather, any task, any time.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for Outfit Wizard stemmed from the horrendous weather Melbourne has encountered in the past week. Arriving to class soaked because we didn't know what to wear was detrimental to our learning.

## What it does
Outfit Wizard generates an outfit for a user based on the current weather of that day, in their location. Certain to fit the needs for the day, we no longer have to think about what to wear for the tasks of the day.

## How we built it
Built using the MERN stack, we utilised ReactJS, Tailwind and MongoDB to build and deploy our code quickly, and get a prototype running.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenges we encountered throughout the process of building Outfit Wizard came from the utilisation of APIs. Finding an API for clothing that was free and fit what we needed was a massive hurdle that really slowed the progress of our project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning new technologies for our web app inherently was a slow but rewarding experience, and we are glad that we have a product to show for it.

## What we learned
Building under a time crunch is difficult - but the learning done in such a short timeframe makes it worth it.

## What's next for Outfit Wizard
Moving forward, we are planning on extending the functionality of Outfit Wizard to include full API embedding for clothing, allowing users to store their wardrobe and clothes. We want users to have a customisable experience with persistent data across sessions - extending past their credentials. We hope to extend this to multiple outfits for a day - a more advanced algorithm for determining fits based on the tasks for the day.
